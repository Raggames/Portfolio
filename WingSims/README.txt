WINGSIMS is a little flight simulation project meant to emulate the feeling of FPV flying fixed wings drone.

The main objective was to implement aeordynamics physics as simple as possible.
The representation of aerodynamic surfaces has been done by projecting the aerosurface plane (a wing, an elevator or a rudder) onto the plane represented by the relative wind vector.

This project is still in progress.

The phase 2 is finishing the implementation of MIRROR as a multiplayer engine to be able to fly with friends.
